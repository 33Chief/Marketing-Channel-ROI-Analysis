# Marketing-Channel-ROI-Analysis
Connecting Marketing Acquisition to Real Profitability

This project analyzes how different marketing channels perform across the full e-commerce funnel — from website sessions to orders, refunds, and profit — using Python-only analytics.

🔍 Overview

Using real-world e-commerce data, this analysis attributes customer orders back to their originating marketing sessions and evaluates each channel based on conversion, revenue, refunds, and profit.

Rather than stopping at conversion rates, the project focuses on refund-adjusted profitability, answering the question:

Which marketing channels actually drive profitable growth?
